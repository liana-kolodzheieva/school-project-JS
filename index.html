          Hello! Yes, on this page we will superficially study some of the
          functions available in the JS programming language (java script)

        <h3>About JS</h3>
        <h4>
          at the beginning I want to tell you who JS is and where it is used
        </h4>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a programming language primarily used on the web. With
          its help, websites are made interactive: they add pop-ups, animations,
          like buttons and forms for submitting information. It is also called
          the main language of the frontend - the “front” side of the site with
          which users interact.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is needed to:</p>
        <p>
          ◉ Make the site interactive - so that it is not just a static page,
          but a dynamic program that responds to user actions. For example, if
          you click the “Like” button and the number of likes on a post
          increases immediately, without refreshing the page. This is the result
          of using JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          ◉ Transfer information between the user and the server. It is the
          scripts written in JavaScript that send the information entered by the
          user to the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          ◉ Animate objects - add scrolling to a section by pressing a button,
          background animation, moving objects.
        </p>
        <p>and much more, but for now we will look at the JS base</p>
