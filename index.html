                Hello! Yes, on this page we will superficially study some of the
                functions available in the JS programming language (java script)
              </p>

              <h3>About JS</h3>
              <p>
                At the beginning I want to tell you who JS is and where it is
                used
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript is a programming language primarily used on the web.
                With its help, websites are made interactive: they add pop-ups,
                animations, like buttons and forms for submitting information.
                It is also called the main language of the frontend - the
                “front” side of the site with which users interact.
              </p>
              <p>JavaScript is needed to:</p>
              <p>
                ◉ Make the site interactive - so that it is not just a static
                page, but a dynamic program that responds to user actions. For
                example, if you click the “Like” button and the number of likes
                on a post increases immediately, without refreshing the page.
                This is the result of using JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                ◉ Transfer information between the user and the server. It is
                the scripts written in JavaScript that send the information
                entered by the user to the server.
              </p>
              <p>
                ◉ Animate objects - add scrolling to a section by pressing a
                button, background animation, moving objects.
              </p>
              <p>and much more, but for now we will look at the JS base</p>
              <p>So let's go!</p>
